Feature: (Unbreakable Vow)

    Causes a vow taken by a witch or wizard to be inviolable; if he or she
    should break it, the consequence is death. It manifests itself as
    interlinking chains of fire binding the clasped hands of the people taking
    the Vow; the fire shoots out as a tongue of flame from the wand of the
    Binder (a witness to the Vow) every time the person who takes the vow makes
    a promise. The flames then form into the linking chains. According to Ron
    Weasley, the spell causes death to anyone who breaks the vow.
