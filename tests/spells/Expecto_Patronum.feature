Feature: Expecto Patronum (Patronus Charm)

    Conjures an incarnation of the caster's innermost positive feelings, such
    as joy or hope, known as a Patronus. A Patronus is conjured as a protector,
    and is a weapon rather than a predator of souls: Patronuses shield their
    conjurors from Dementors or Lethifolds, and can even drive them away. They
    are also used amongst the Order of the Phoenix to send messages. According
    to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Charm is the only known
    defensive spell against Lethifolds.

        First seen in Prisoner of Azkaban when a Dementor appears in the

        Dementor by casting a silvery object from his wand. Harry's corporeal
        Patronus first appears in a Quidditch game, and other characters
        throughout the rest of the series use it.
