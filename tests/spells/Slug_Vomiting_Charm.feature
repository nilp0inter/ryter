    Seen/mentioned:
        In Chamber of Secrets, Ron attempts to use it on Draco by saying "Eat
        Slugs"; the spell backfired and hit him instead. Mentioned in Order of
        the Phoenix before Gryffindor's first Quidditch Match against Slytherin
        when Draco taunts Ron, "Harry was reminded forcibly of the time that
        Ron had accidentally put a Slug-Vomiting Charm on himself".[OP Ch.19]
