    Seen/mentioned:
        First mentioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when it was
        briefly used by Molly Weasley on the Weasley twins to confiscate their
        Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes' products from their pockets, before they left
        for the Quidditch World Cup. Hermione was also mentioned trying to
        learn this charm during her ride aboard the Hogwarts Express. Later on
        in the same book, Harry summons his broom to complete the First Task of
        the Triwizard Tournament.[GF Ch.20] Near the end of the book, Harry
        uses it to summon the Triwizard Cup after he encounters Voldemort. When
        Ron goes mad in the department of mysteries in Order of the Phoenix, he
        attempts to use it to summon a brain. Harry uses this spell to summon
        Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows but fails.
