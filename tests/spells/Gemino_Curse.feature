Feature: (Gemino Curse)

    Whenever an object affected by this curse is touched, it duplicates itself
    into many useless copies to hide the original. To add confusion and
    eventually fill the surrounding area with copies, the copies also
    duplicate.

    Seen/mentioned:
        Seen in Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Griphook break
        into the Lestrange vault in Gringotts. Used to great effect as the room
        fills with useless duplicates.
