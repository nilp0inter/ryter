    Seen/mentioned:
        In Prisoner of Azkaban, it is explained that when Harry was an infant,
        he and his parents, James and Lily Potter, were hidden from Voldemort
        by this charm. Later, in Order of the Phoenix, the charm is used to
        hide the location of the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix.
        Order members in Deathly Hallows also use it to protect their homes.

    Notes:
        Rowling previously stated that when a Secret-Keeper dies, the Secret
        they held can never be revealed to anyone else; the people who were
        told before the Secret-Keeper's death will still know the secret, but
        after the death of the Secret-Keeper no one new can be brought into the
        circle of knowledge. However, in Deathly Hallows, it is explained that
        upon the Keeper's death, all those who have been told the secret become
        Secret-Keepers in turn, and can pass the secret on to others.
