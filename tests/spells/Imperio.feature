Feature: Imperio (Imperius Curse)

    Causes the victim of the curse to obey the spoken/unspoken commands of the
    caster. The experience of being controlled by this curse is described as a
    complete, wonderful release from any sense of responsibility or worry over
    one's actions, at the price of one's free will. Resisting the effect of the
    curse is possible, however, and several individuals have been able to
    successfully overcome it, including Harry and both of the Crouches, who
    learn to resist the curse after being subjected to its effects for an
    extended period. Harry describes the feeling of being the caster as
    controlling a marionette through a wand (although Harry's particular
    experience is suspect due to his lack of commitment to casting Unforgivable
    Curses). One of the three Unforgivable Curses.
