Feature: Sectumsempra

    Violently wounds the target; described as being as though the subject had
    been "slashed by a sword". Created by Severus Snape.

    Pronunciation:
        /ˌsɛktəmˈsɛmprə/ SEK-təm-SEM-prə
    Seen/mentioned:
        First seen in Order of the Phoenix when Snape uses it in his memory
        against James, but misses and only lightly cuts his cheek. Used
        successfully by Harry in Half-Blood Prince against Draco, and then
        later against the Inferi in Voldemort's Horcrux chamber, and Snape
        during his flight from Hogwarts. In the opening chapters of Deathly
        Hallows, Snape accidentally casts this curse against George Weasley in
        the Order's flight from Privet Drive, though George was not his
        intended target. [DH Ch.3] It is known as a speciality of Snape's. [DH
        Ch.5]

    Notes:
        Though Snape was able to mend the wounds inflicted on Draco by this
        curse with ease, with "an incantation that sounded almost like song",
        Mrs Weasley was unable to heal her son George when his ear was severed
        by the curse. It was discovered in an old copy of Advanced Potion
        Making by Harry; Sectumsempra was invented by Snape with the words "For
        enemies" written next to it.
