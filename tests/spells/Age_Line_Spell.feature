Feature: (Age Line Spell)

    Creates a thin, shimmering line that can only be passed by people of a set
    age. Aging potions are useless against age lines. Incantation unknown. As
    demonstrated by Fred and George Weasley, attempting to use an ageing potion
    and stepping over the line appears to work, but moments later they are seen
    with grey hair and beards. It is unknown whether the ageing potion causes
    this alongside the age line spell.
