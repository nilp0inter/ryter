Feature: (Taboo)

    A jinx which may be placed upon a word or a name, so that whenever that
    word is spoken, a magical disturbance is created that alerts the caster of
    the Taboo to the location of the speaker. Any protective enchantments in
    effect around the speaker are broken when the Tabooed word is spoken aloud.

    Seen/mentioned:
        In Deathly Hallows, this spell is placed on the word "Voldemort";
        Harry, Ron and Hermione are tracked this way to Tottenham Court Road.
        Ron tells the other two to stop using the word as he began to fear the
        name might be a jinx, later discovering it to be a Taboo. The Taboo on
        Voldemort's name proves useful in identifying supporters of Harry
        Potter, since the name is so feared that only "rebels" dare speak it.
        Later in the book, Harry accidentally says Voldemort's name again,
        resulting in the trio being caught by Snatchers and taken to Malfoy
        Manor.
