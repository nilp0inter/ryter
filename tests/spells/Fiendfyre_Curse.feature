    Seen/mentioned:
        In Deathly Hallows, Vincent Crabbe uses Fiendfyre in the Room of
        Requirement against Harry, Ron, and Hermione who manage to escape on
        broomsticks with Draco and Goyle.[DH Ch.31]
    Suggested etymology: - 
    Notes:
        It is only used by Crabbe throughout in Deathly Hallows, who Harry
        believes learned it from the Carrows[DH Ch.31] during their tenure as
        teachers at Hogwarts. Therefore, Crabbe inadvertently destroyed one of
        Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes.
