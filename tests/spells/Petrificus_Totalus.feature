Feature: Petrificus Totalus (Body-Bind Curse)

    Used to temporarily bind the victim's body in a position much like that of
    a soldier at attention; this spell does not restrict breathing or seeing,
    and the victim will usually fall to the ground.

    Pronunciation:

    Seen/mentioned:
        First used in Philosopher's Stone by Hermione, who was trying to
        prevent Neville from stopping her, Ron, and Harry from leaving the
        common room to hunt for the Philosopher's Stone.[PS Ch.16] It is then
        used throughout the rest of the series, especially during the Battle of
        the Department of Mysteries in Order of the Phoenix. Seen in Half-Blood
        Prince twice: in the beginning, Draco uses the spell against Harry on
        the train, and later when Dumbledore casts the spell non-verbally to
        make Harry freeze so he does not give himself away in the Astronomy
        Tower. The spell was broken when Dumbledore was killed.

        Stone, and in the Deathly Hallows.
