    Pronunciation: -

        Quidditch Through the Ages, Chapter 4. e.g. "the wizards in the crowd
        forced [the snidget] back with repelling spells".
    Suggested etymology: - 
    Notes:
        This is only mentioned repelling the snidget (a small but agile bird).
        However context suggests the spell is a generic repelling spell, but we
        do not know the extent or limitations. It was used to prevent the bird
        escaping the confines of the quidditch pitch.
