Feature: Locomotor

    The spell is always used with the name of a target, at which the wand is
    pointed (e.g. "Locomotor Trunk!"). The spell causes the named object to
    rise in the air and move around at the will of the caster.

    Pronunciation:
        /ˌloʊkɵˈmoʊtɔr/ LOH-ko-MOH-tor
    Seen/mentioned:
        Used by Tonks in Order of the Phoenix to move Harry's trunk from his
        room. Flitwick similarly uses it to move Sybill Trelawney's trunk after
        Umbridge sacks her. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown use this spell to
        race their pencil cases around the edges of the table. A variation seen
        in Deathly Hallows is Piertotum Locomotor, which animated the suits of
        armour in Hogwarts.
