    Seen/mentioned:
        First seen in Goblet of Fire, when Fleur put the fire out on her skirt
        "with a bit of water from her wand." First named in Half-Blood Prince,
        when Harry is being taught how to perform this specific charm in
        Professor Flitwick's class. Later Harry casts this spell in an attempt
        to create water for Dumbledore to drink after taking Voldemort's
        potion[HBP Ch.26], and again to douse Hagrid's hut after it is set on
        fire.[HBP Ch.28][DH Ch.31].
