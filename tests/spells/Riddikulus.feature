Feature: Riddikulus

    A spell used when fighting a Boggart, "Riddikulus" forces the Boggart to
    take the appearance of an object upon which the caster is concentrating.
    When used correctly, this will be a humorous form.

        First seen in Prisoner of Azkaban, when taught by Lupin. Then seen in

    Notes:
        The effect depends on what the caster is thinking. Neville concentrates
        on his grandmother's dress, causing a Boggart in the form of Snape to
        appear in it.
