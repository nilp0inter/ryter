Feature: Impedimenta (Impediment Jinx, Impediment Curse)

    This powerful spell is capable of tripping, freezing, binding, knocking
    back and generally impeding the target's progress towards the caster. The
    extent to which the spell's specific action can be controlled by the caster
    is not made clear. If this spell does bind, it does eventually wear off as
    stated in Deathly Hallows.

        Draco. Also seen toward the end of Order of the Phoenix, when Harry is
        fighting the Death Eaters. Stronger uses of this spell seem capable of
