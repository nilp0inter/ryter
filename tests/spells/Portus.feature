    Notes:
        Portkeys were first seen in Goblet of Fire as a means for Harry,
        Hermione, and the Weasleys to go to the Quidditch World Cup. However,
        the spell used in its creation was not seen until Order of the Phoenix
        when Dumbledore creates a Portkey to get Harry Potter and Fred, George,
        Ron, and Ginny Weasley to Grimmauld Place.[OP Ch.22] Also requires
        Ministry approval to use.
