        This spell is used by Mr Weasley to allow eight people, six large
        trunks, two owls, and a rat to fit comfortably inside his modified Ford
        Anglia in Chamber of Secrets. Hermione casts this spell upon her small
        beaded handbag in Deathly Hallows. Probably used in Goblet of Fire to
