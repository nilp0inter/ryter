    Pronunciation:
        /oʊˈblɪvi.eɪt/ oh-BLIV-ee-ayt
    Seen/mentioned:
        First mentioned (not by name) in the Philosopher's Stone by Ron that it
        was used on Muggles who have seen dragons. First used in Chamber of
        Secrets by Lockhart who wanted to use it on Harry and Ron; the spell
        backfired because Ron's wand had been damaged, causing Lockhart to lose
        most of his own memory (which he never recovers). In Goblet of Fire, it
        is used by an unknown Ministry worker on Mr. Roberts and later the rest
        of his family. In Deathly Hallows, Hermione uses the spell on two Death
        Eaters who had followed Harry, Ron, and Hermione after their escape
        from Bill Weasley and Fleur's wedding. Also used by Hermione on
        Xenophilius Lovegood after destroying his house in Deathly Hallows and
        erasing her parents memories of herself.
