Feature: Levicorpus

    The victim is dangled upside-down by one of his/her ankles, sometimes
    accompanied by a flash of white light. Created by Severus Snape. Its
    counter curse is Liberacorpus.

    Pronunciation:
        /lɛvɨˈkɔrpəs/ LEV-i-KOR-pəs (usually nonverbal)
    Seen/mentioned:
        It was originally shown to be a nonverbal-only spell, but in the
        Deathly Hallows, the text shows that Hermione whispers it to lift Harry
        so he can steal the Cup of Helga Hufflepuff. Harry learns it by reading
        the notes written by the Half-Blood Prince. He inadvertently uses it on
        Ron in Half-Blood Prince. In addition, in Order of Phoenix, Harry sees
        (through the Pensieve) his father, James, use the spell against Snape.
    Suggested etymology: - 
    Notes:
        Though Harry initially learns Levicorpus as a nonverbal spell, it is
        used verbally by James Potter in The Order of the Phoenix and by
        Hermione Granger in The Deathly Hallows
