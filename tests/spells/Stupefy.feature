        Quidditch World Cup and later against Barty Crouch Jr.. Also seen used
        by a number of Ministry officials against McGonagall in Order of the
        Phoenix. It is also taught by Harry in his Dumbledore's Army meetings
        and used extensively during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries
        against the Death Eaters. Is seen by some, including Harry himself, as
        the basic spell for fighting. Death Eaters, Ministry Officials, Order
        members and students all seem to refer to this spell as their preferred
        attack.

    Notes:
        Hagrid was able to withstand multiple direct Stunners due to being
        half-giant, and Goblet of Fire shows six to seven wizards working in
        unison to Stun a single dragon.
