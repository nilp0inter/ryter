    Seen/mentioned:
        Slughorn had it on a temporary Muggle owned house he was living in,
        allowing him to detect Dumbledore and Harry as they approached in Half-
        Blood Prince. It is possible that Alastor Moody had it on his house to
        set off charmed dustbins (which spewed litter at intruders) if there
        was an intruder on his property.
