    Seen/mentioned:
        An unnamed spell, presumably incarcerous, is used by Lupin to tie up
        Snape in the Shrieking Shack in Prisoner of Azkaban and likewise in
        Goblet of Fire when Pettigrew ties Harry to Tom Riddle's grave.
        Incarcerous itself is first heard in Order of the Phoenix, when
        Umbridge gets in a battle with the centaurs. Also used by Harry on the
        Inferi in Voldemort's Horcrux chamber, in Half-Blood Prince, and later
        again when Harry tries to bound Snape after the death of Dumbledore.
