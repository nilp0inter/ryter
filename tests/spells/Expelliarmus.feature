    Pronunciation:
        /ɛksˌpɛliˈɑrməs/ eks-PEL-ee-AR-məs
    Seen/mentioned:
        First seen in Chamber of Secrets, when Snape disarms Gilderoy Lockhart
        in the Duelling Club; from then on it is commonly used throughout the
        rest of the series. Draco uses it to disarm Dumbledore and Harry used
        it during his first (Goblet of Fire) and last duel (Deathly Hallows)
        with Voldemort. As such, at the beginning of Deathly Hallows, Death
        Eaters consider it Harry Potter's trademark and correctly identify
        Harry by the sight of this spell.
