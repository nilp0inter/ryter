Feature: Avada Kedavra (Killing Curse)

    Causes instant, painless death to whomever the curse hits. There is no
    countercurse or method of blocking this spell; however, if someone
    sacrifices their life for someone else, the person who was saved will not
    encounter any adverse effects of any curses by the specific attacker (e.g.
    when Lily Potter sacrificed her life for Harry Potter at Voldemort's hands,
    Harry became immune to curses cast by Voldemort). One of the three
    Unforgivable Curses.

    Pronunciation:
        /əˈvɑːdə kəˈdɑːvrə/ ə-VAH-də kə-DAH-vrə
    Seen/mentioned:
        First said (not by name) at the beginning of the first book when Harry
        arrives at the Dursleys' home. Seen first in Goblet of Fire against
        Muggle Frank Bryce, and in every book following.Suggested etymology:
        During an audience interview at the Edinburgh Book Festival (15 April
        2004) Rowling said: "Does anyone know where Avada Kedavra came from? It
        is an ancient spell in Aramaic, and it is the original of Abracadabra,
        which means 'let the thing be destroyed'. Originally, it was used to
        cure illness and the 'thing' was the illness, but I decided to make it
        the 'thing' as in the person standing in front of me. I take a lot of
        liberties with things like that. I twist them round and make them
        mine." Rowling's use of this name may have been influenced by Latin
        cadaver = "corpse".
