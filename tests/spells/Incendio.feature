    Seen/mentioned:
        It is first seen in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone when
        Hagrid (nonverbally) produces fire out of his umbrella in the little
        house the Dursleys took refuge in (from the Hogwarts letters). In Half-
        Blood Prince, this spell is used several times in battle, for instance
        when Hagrid's hut is set ablaze.
