    Seen/mentioned:
        First seen in The Philosopher's Stone, when Flitwick's first-year class
        practice the spell on feathers. Later in that book, Ron performs the
        spell on the club of a mountain troll.[PS Ch.10] Harry uses it to hold
        himself up on Hagrid's motorbike much later on, in The Deathly Hallows.
        Later in the same book, Ron uses it to prod the knot at the base of the
        Whomping Willow with a twig to allow him, Harry and Hermione into the
        Shrieking Shack.[DH Ch.32]Anastasaki, Elena (2005). "Harry Potter
